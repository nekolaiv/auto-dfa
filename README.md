# 🌀 AutoDFA

**AutoDFA** is a lightweight web app built with **Next.js**, **TailwindCSS**, and **shadcn/ui** that lets you **design and visualize Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)**.
It’s crafted for **students, educators, and enthusiasts** exploring automata theory.

> ⚠️ Note: This project is **static** — DFA states and inputs will reset on reload.
> It’s mainly for **learning and quick experimentation**, not persistent storage.

* ⌨️ **Custom Input** — enter language patterns or state rules to test.
* 📚 **Educational Focus** — built to reinforce concepts in formal languages and automata theory.
* ⚡ **Modern Stack** — Next.js + TailwindCSS + shadcn for sleek UI.

## 🎯 Use Case

AutoDFA is perfect if you want to:

* Learn DFA construction interactively.
* Practice with small problems (like “strings with at least 2 b’s followed by 3 a’s”).
* Visualize **state transitions** without manually drawing them on paper.

## 🌟 Future Ideas

* [ ] Add support for **NFA → DFA conversion**.
* [ ] Enable **regex → DFA generation**.
* [ ] Save/load automata in local storage.
* [ ] Export DFA diagrams.
